Difference between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2

HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) has been the foundation of web communication since the 1990s. 
As the web evolved, there was a need to improve the efficiency, speed, and performance of this protocol. 
This led to the development of HTTP/2, a major revision of HTTP. Let's delve into the main differences between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.

1. Binary vs. Textual Protocol
HTTP/1.1: Uses a textual format, which means that messages are constructed using readable characters. 
While this can be useful for manual debugging, it can also lead to inefficiencies and potential errors due to textual parsing.

HTTP/2: Adopts a binary protocol. Frames (the smallest unit of communication in HTTP/2) are encoded in binary format. 
This leads to faster, more robust parsing and reduces potential errors.

2. Multiplexing
HTTP/1.1: Each transfer requires a new connection, leading to the "head-of-line" blocking problem where a single slow transfer can hold up multiple transfers.

HTTP/2: Supports multiple transfers over a single connection via multiplexing. This means multiple requests and responses can be handled in parallel without 
blocking each other, which improves the efficiency of network resource utilization.

3. Connection Management
HTTP/1.1: Utilizes multiple connections to overcome the limitation of one request-response per connection. This can lead to overhead and inefficiencies.

HTTP/2: Requires only one connection per origin, which remains open as long as the website is accessed, thereby reducing the overhead and latency associated with 
establishing multiple connections.

4. Server Push
HTTP/1.1: Lacks a mechanism for servers to send additional data to clients without an explicit request from the client.

HTTP/2: Introduces the server push feature where servers can send resources proactively to the client's cache, anticipating future requests. 
This reduces the latency in fetching resources, as the client may already have them preloaded.

5. Header Compression
HTTP/1.1: Transmits headers in plain text, leading to redundancy and increased overhead, especially when multiple headers are repeated across requests.

HTTP/2: Introduces HPACK compression, which allows headers to be transmitted in a compressed format. This not only reduces overhead but also speeds up data transmission.

6. Prioritization
HTTP/1.1: Does not have built-in mechanisms for prioritizing resource requests.

HTTP/2: Allows requests to be assigned priority levels. Clients can indicate which resources are more important, and servers can then allocate bandwidth accordingly.

7. Stream Dependencies
HTTP/1.1: Lacks any concept of stream dependencies.

HTTP/2: Introduces the concept of stream dependencies, which allows the client to hint at how it would like multiple requests to be multiplexed over a single connection.

Conclusion
The transition from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2 marks a significant step in the evolution of web protocols. HTTP/2 addresses many of the performance and efficiency issues 
found in its predecessor, offering an improved browsing experience for end users. While the adoption of HTTP/2 is still underway, its advantages make it an essential 
tool in modern web development and communications.
